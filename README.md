The  Online  Shopping  system application  enables vendors to setup on line shops, customers to browse through the shops, and a system administrator to approve and reject requests for new shops and maintain lists of shop categories. Also the developer is designing an online shopping site to manage the items in the shop and also help customers to purchase them online without visiting the shop physically.The online shopping system will use the internet as the sole method for selling goods to its consumers.
