# Architecture Overview
## Client-Side Components
>Users interact with the application through a web browser or mobile app, using a user interface that allows them to browse products and make purchases.
## Application Layer
>This layer consists of web servers that handle incoming requests, a load balancer that distributes requests across multiple servers, application servers that process requests and communicate with the data layer, a caching layer that stores frequently accessed data for improved performance, and session management to handle user sessions.
## Business Logic Layer
>This layer includes components such as the product catalog, which manages product information; the shopping cart, responsible for cart operations; user management for registration and authentication; order management for processing and tracking orders, and a recommendation engine that provides personalized product recommendations.
## Data Layer
>This layer includes a relational database for structured data like user profiles, product information, and orders; distributed file storage for storing product images and media files, and an analytics database for collecting and analyzing user behavior and business metrics.
## External Services
>Integration with external services includes a payment gateway for secure payment processing, shipping and logistics services for calculating shipping costs and tracking shipments, and email and notification services for sending transactional emails and updates to users.
## Security Considerations
> SSL certificates ensure secure communication, user authentication mechanisms protect user accounts, encryption is used to safeguard sensitive data, input validation prevents common security vulnerabilities, and regular security audits and penetration testing help identify and address any security weaknesses.
